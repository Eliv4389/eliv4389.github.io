        <h2>Hello, I'm Eli Vidal!</h2>
        <p>
            

Dive into my world, where creativity meets innovation and dreams become projects. As a proud TAU graduate, my journey through the maze of operations and strategy has equipped me with a unique blend of expertise and vision. As the EDI Enrollment Specialist for Athelas, I'm not just fixing failed healthcare paymentsâ€”I'm redesigning the future of healthcare transactions.

With my roots in Social Work and wings in an MBA, I soar through challenges, constantly expanding my horizons. My projects, each a testament to my passion, showcase my insatiable thirst for excellence. 

But who is Eli beyond the tech and strategy? An adventurer at heart, I've traversed both the pages of riveting novels and the winding trails of far-off lands. And yes, I'm that person who knows the best local spots in every city!

            Eli is an extremely talented individual. He went from zero knowledge to being the knowledge specialist at our company for doing EDI & billing. I highly recommend Eli for his strong work ethic, honesty, and affable nature. I hope to work with him again in the future!

          Eli worked with us setting up operations around coordinating onboardings, client success, and technical EDI interfaces. He was always prompt, reliable, and willing to jump in wherever needed. He is extremely effective at what he does, communicates proactively, and is a great person to work with. He is a quick learner, fast executor, and great teammate.

          Eli excels at delivering top-notch support experience to customers in both Hebrew and English languages, irrespective of the support modality. His management skill is terrific! I've seen Eli managed a newly activated team and provided a holistic, timely report that tremendously helped to improve operational efficiency and achieve set goals much faster. He's productive and efficient in his style of operation and overall engagement.
