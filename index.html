            But who is Eli beyond the tech and strategy? An adventurer at heart, I've traversed both the pages of riveting novels and the winding trails of far-off lands. And yes, I'm that person who knows the best local spots in every city!

          Eli worked with us setting up operations around coordinating onboardings, client success, and technical EDI interfaces. He was always prompt, reliable, and willing to jump in wherever needed. He is extremely effective at what he does, communicates proactively, and is a great person to work with. He is a quick learner, fast executor, and great teammate.

          Eli excels at delivering top-notch support experience to customers in both Hebrew and English languages, irrespective of the support modality. His management skill is terrific! I've seen Eli managed a newly activated team and provided a holistic, timely report that tremendously helped to improve operational efficiency and achieve set goals much faster. He's productive and efficient in his style of operation and overall engagement.
